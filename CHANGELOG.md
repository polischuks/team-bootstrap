# Changelog

All notable changes to team-bootstrap. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-10

Initial productized release. Distribution structure, full P0 + P1 implementation, top-level docs.

### Added

- **Subagent dispatch model** ([references/subagent-dispatch.md](references/subagent-dispatch.md)) — when roles run inline vs. as Task-tool subagents.
- **Shared blackboard** ([references/shared-blackboard.md](references/shared-blackboard.md)) — full run document available to every role.
- **Irreversibility taxonomy** ([references/irreversibility.md](references/irreversibility.md)) — four-class action gating replaces role-level approval booleans.
- **Tracing spec** ([references/tracing.md](references/tracing.md)) — OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions, run/role/tool span hierarchy, replay format.
- **Role versioning** ([references/versioning.md](references/versioning.md)) — semver per role, eval-gate convention.
- **Memory model** ([references/memory.md](references/memory.md)) — three-tier (persistent / per-run / per-role), checkpoint and resume.
- **AGENTS.md contract** ([references/agents-md-contract.md](references/agents-md-contract.md)) — required fields, per-role consumption.
- **MCP integration** ([references/mcp-integration.md](references/mcp-integration.md)) — tool-surface mapping to MCP servers.
- **Tool surface** in every role frontmatter — allow/deny lists, MCP servers, permission mode.
- **Verification loops** in `backend-engineer` and `frontend-engineer` — explicit edit→verify→repair with bounded attempts.
- **Single-thread pipeline** ([references/pipelines/single-thread.md](references/pipelines/single-thread.md)) — recommended default.
- **Role frontmatter schema** ([references/schemas/role-frontmatter.schema.json](references/schemas/role-frontmatter.schema.json)).
- Top-level docs: [README.md](README.md), [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), [USAGE.md](USAGE.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Plugin manifest at [.claude-plugin/plugin.json](.claude-plugin/plugin.json).
- Examples: [examples/AGENTS.md.template](examples/AGENTS.md.template), [examples/quickstart-spec.md](examples/quickstart-spec.md).
- Eval suite skeleton at [evals/](evals/).

### Changed

- `next_role` in role templates uses `<determined-by-pipeline>` placeholder; orchestrator resolves from active pipeline.
- `role-output.schema.json` — root `oneOf` discriminator on `role`; `unevaluatedProperties: false` per role; per-role required fields for 12 roles (release_decision, severity_counts, verdict, ci_status, etc.).
- [failure-policy.md](references/failure-policy.md) — irreversibility classes drive approval gates instead of role-level booleans.
- [orchestrator.md](references/orchestrator.md) — incorporates shared-blackboard load step and subagent-dispatch decision point.
- [trace-evals.md](references/trace-evals.md) — cross-links to tracing.md (capture) and versioning.md (regression gate).
- [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) — points to README/USAGE/ARCHITECTURE as primary entry; retains handoff contract reference.

### Migration from pre-1.0

- Hardcoded `next_role` values were replaced with placeholders. No action needed if you used the bundled orchestrator.
- Role files now require frontmatter (`version`, `tool_surface`, `permission_mode`). Custom roles must be updated.
- Per-role required handoff fields are enforced. Custom handoffs that omit them will fail validation.
- `manual_approval_requested` at role level still works but is deprecated. Use `irreversibility_class` per action ([references/irreversibility.md](references/irreversibility.md)).

## Pre-1.0

Earlier versions used hardcoded `next_role` per role and a JSON Schema with `$defs` only (no root discriminator). See git history for details.
